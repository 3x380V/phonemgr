Phone Manager
=============

This program will connect to your mobile phone over a serial port,
either via a cable, infra-red or Bluetooth connection.

It listens for text messages, and when they arrive, displays them on the
desktop.  A visual indicator is displayed in the notification area, if
one is presently added to the panel.

Phone Manager is currently a work in progress, see the TODO file for
tasks left undone and BUGS for problems that I know about.
