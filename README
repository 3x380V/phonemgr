Phone Manager
=============

This applet will connect to your mobile phone over a serial port,
either via a cable, infra-red or Bluetooth connection.

It listens for text messages, and when they arrive, displays them
on the desktop.

Phone Manager is currently a work in progress, see the TODO file for
tasks left undone and BUGS for problems that I know about.

Building
--------

You need:

* Bluetooth libs, utils and sdp installed installed (bluez.sf.net)

* Bluetooth kernel modules installed (must use kernel 2.4.20 or
  patches from bluez.sf.net)

* gnome-bluetooth and libbtctl, from
  http://usefulinc.com/software/gnome-bluetooth

* These GNOME 2 packages:
    sigc++-1.2 libgnomeuimm-2.0 gconfmm-2.0
    gtkmm-2.0 glibmm-2.0 glibmm-2.0 glib-2.0 libgnomeui-2.0 >= 1.110.0
    libpanelapplet-2.0 libgnome-2.0 gdk-pixbuf-2.0 gconf-2.0
    libbonobo-2.0 bonobo-activation-2.0

  (some of the *mm packages are still called *mm1.3 as they're still in
   development.)

   libsigc++ can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsigc/

* gsmlib 1.10, with the patch from http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=168475
  applied (works, even though the patch is against 1.9).
  gsmlib homepage is http://www.pxh.de/fs/gsmlib/
	-- or gsmlib 1.11 or better, when released.
