gnome-phone-manager 0.4
=======================

 * User interface style improvements.

 * Add preference for whether or not to receive popup dialogs.

 * Add optional audible alert of message.

 * Now supports most Latin 1 characters in messages.

 * Makes serial-port timeout more generous and empties message queue
   before reconnection.

 * Warns if notification area not present.

gnome-phone-manager 0.3
=======================

 * More or less 100% rewritten to use the new gnome-bluetooth framework,
   no feature difference from previous release.
   
 * Restricted use of C++ to the GSM mobile phone communication code.
   Nothing personal against C++, I was just fed up of Debian not tracking
   the libgnome*mm libraries well.
