gnome-phone-manager 0.7
=======================

 * Move the model/driver matching to an XML file, making it easier to
   add new models without recompilation

 * Avoid reconnection to the phone when we already use the AT driver

 * Fix installation of the icon files, and menu items

 * Fix the phone number entry not appearing on startup

 * Add support to the Nokia 6021 and Nokia 6230 models

gnome-phone-manager 0.6
=======================

 * Completion support in the destination text entry, via Evolution's
   addressbook

 * Use libgnokii instead of libgsm to send and receive SMS messages, which
   means we support more phones than the previous versions

gnome-phone-manager 0.4
=======================

 * User interface style improvements.

 * Add preference for whether or not to receive popup dialogs.

 * Add optional audible alert of message.

 * Now supports most Latin 1 characters in messages.

 * Makes serial-port timeout more generous and empties message queue
   before reconnection.

 * Warns if notification area not present.

gnome-phone-manager 0.3
=======================

 * More or less 100% rewritten to use the new gnome-bluetooth framework,
   no feature difference from previous release.
   
 * Restricted use of C++ to the GSM mobile phone communication code.
   Nothing personal against C++, I was just fed up of Debian not tracking
   the libgnome*mm libraries well.
