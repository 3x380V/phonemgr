============

 * More or less 100% rewritten to use the new gnome-bluetooth framework,
   no feature difference from previous release.
   
 * Restricted use of C++ to the GSM mobile phone communication code.
   Nothing personal against C++, I was just fed up of Debian not tracking
   the libgnome*mm libraries well.
